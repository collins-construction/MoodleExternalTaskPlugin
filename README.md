# External Task question type
This plugin allows for external tasks to be included in a quiz, followed by manual grading.

The plugin was developed for Collins Construction (www.collins-construction.com) where it is used to evaluate staff member's mastery of our internal project management and other information management tools.

## An example application
1. The question/task: Open budget.xlsx and enter a formula in cell D45 which calculates the total value of all products purchased.

2. The student opens the Excel file and completes the task.

3. They return to Moodle and tick to indicate that they have completed the task.

4. Ticking the box marks the question as attempted.

5. They submit the quiz

6. The teacher opens the spreadsheet to review the student's work, and then enters their grade manually.

## Installation and usage

The plugin uses the standard Moodle plugin installation processes.

1. Add a new question to a quiz.

2. Select External Task as the question type

3. Most settings are indentical in form and operation to other question types (especially the Essay question type)

4. Under Response Options, set the wording for the task completion checkbox (the default is "I have completed the task")

## Acknowledgements

The plugin was started by cloning the Essay question type, as this is (currently) the only question type that allows for manual grading.
